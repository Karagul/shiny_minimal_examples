# shiny_minimal_examples

Minimal examples of various functionality in Shiny.

Minimal examples are useful for sharing, reproducing, and learning. I hope to add many minimal example apps to this repo over time.  The aim is for this repo to be a useful reference for beginners looking to learn and more experienced Shiny developers looking to replicate common functionality.
